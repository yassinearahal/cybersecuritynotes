**Introduction to Webshells:**

In the realm of cybersecurity, webshells emerge as invaluable tools when interacting with websites that permit the uploading of executable files. A **webshell** is essentially a script, often coded in languages like PHP or ASP, designed to operate within a web server environment. These scripts facilitate the execution of commands on the server by allowing users to input them through a webpageâ€”either via HTML forms or as URL parameters. This capability becomes particularly advantageous when traditional reverse or bind shell uploads are impractical or restricted.

**Usage of Webshells:**

A common and straightforward example is a PHP webshell in a concise one-line format:

```php
<?php echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]) . "</pre>"; ?>
```

Here, users can input commands in the URL after `?cmd=` to have them executed on the server. This enables interaction with the system, making tasks such as checking network information or running various commands feasible.

Additionally, when targeting Windows servers, webshells offer a practical means of Remote Code Execution (RCE). For instance, URL encoding is often employed for PowerShell reverse shells, allowing users to interact with Windows servers effectively:

Understanding the usage of webshells is pivotal in scenarios where direct execution of traditional shells is restricted, offering a versatile and effective means of interaction with servers. Webshells serve as a practical foothold for further exploitation, especially when firewalls are in place or direct shell execution is constrained.
