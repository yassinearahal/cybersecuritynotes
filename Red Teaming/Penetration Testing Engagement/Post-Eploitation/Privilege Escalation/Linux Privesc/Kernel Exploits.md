##### **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Kernel Exploit Methodology</mark>:**

1. **Identify Kernel Version:**
    - Crucial for pinpointing potential vulnerabilities.
```bash
1. `uname -a`: displays all system information, including the kernel version number.

2. `uname -r`: prints the kernel release.

3. `cat /proc/version`: displays kernel version information. The version number is usually found at the start of the line.

4. `cat /proc/cmdline`: displays kernel command line parameters, which may include the kernel version.

5. `ls /boot`: lists the files in the `/boot` directory, which often includes the kernel image and other version-specific files.

6. `dmesg | grep Linux`: searches the system message log for lines containing the word 'Linux', which often includes the kernel version number.

7. `find /lib/modules/*/ -type f -iname 'version*' 2>/dev/null`: finds all `version*` files in the `/lib/modules` directory, which often include the kernel version.

```

1. **Search for Exploit Code:**
    - Utilize search engines like Google or dedicated sources such as [Linux Kernel CVEs](https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/cves).
3. **Run the Exploit:**
    - Execute the identified exploit code, leveraging vulnerabilities in the target system's kernel.

##### **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Important Considerations</mark>:**

- **Risk of System Crash:**
    
    - Kernel exploits, if unsuccessful, can lead to system crashes. Evaluate the acceptability of this outcome within the context of our penetration testing engagement.
- **Research Sources:**
    
    - Google searches, Linux Kernel CVEs, and tools like Linux Exploit Suggester (LES) aid in identifying potential exploits. Be cautious of false positives/negatives.
- **Search Specificity:**
    
    - When searching for exploits, be specific about the kernel version on platforms like Google, Exploit-db, or searchsploit.
- **Understanding Exploit Code:**
    
    - Before execution, comprehend how the exploit code functions. Uninformed use may lead to irreversible changes or security vulnerabilities.
- **Interaction and Instructions:**
    
    - Some exploits may require further interaction. Thoroughly read comments and instructions accompanying the exploit code.
- **Transfer of Exploit Code:**
    
    - Utilize tools like SimpleHTTPServer in Python or wget to securely transfer exploit code from our machine to the target system.
