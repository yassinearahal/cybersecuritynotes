**<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Introduction</mark>:**

Exploiting the PATH variable in Linux offers a potent privilege escalation avenue when a writable folder is present. PATH dictates the order in which the system searches for executables. This technique involves manipulating configurations to execute scripts or binaries with elevated privileges.

**1. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Understanding PATH</mark>:**

   - PATH is a crucial environmental variable specifying executable locations.
   - Dictates the search order for executables.

**2. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Scenario Analysis</mark>:**

   - Examine the current PATH configuration.
   - Key considerations:
      - Identify folders in $PATH.
      - Assess user write privileges.
      - Evaluate the potential to modify $PATH.
      - Identify vulnerable scripts/applications.

**3. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Script or Binary Example</mark>:**

   - Consider a hypothetical script attempting to execute a system binary.
   - The script is compiled with the SUID bit set to run with elevated privileges.

**4. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Executing the Path Script:</mark>**

   - Gain access to a script with the SUID bit, running with root privileges.
   - Upon execution, the script searches for an executable in folders listed under PATH.

**5. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Identifying Writable Folders</mark>:**

   - Use commands like below to discover writable folders.
   
```bash
find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d "/" -f 2 | sort -u
```
   
   - Analyze and identify potential writable locations.
   
**6. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Exploiting a Writable Folder</mark>:**

   - Modify PATH to include a writable folder, e.g., "<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">export PATH=/tmp:$PATH</mark>."
   - Create a script or binary in the writable folder.

**7. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Privilege Escalation</mark>:**

   - The script, running with root privileges, searches for the executable in the modified PATH.
   - Executing the modified script triggers the script or binary, potentially with elevated privileges.

**8. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Folder Comparison</mark>:**

   - Compare writable folders with those in PATH.
   - Ensure a suitable writable folder is present for exploitation.
