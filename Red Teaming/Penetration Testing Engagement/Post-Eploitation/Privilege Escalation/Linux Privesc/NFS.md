- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Privilege Escalation Vectors Overview</mark>:**

  Privilege escalation is not confined to internal access; it extends to shared folders and remote management interfaces like SSH and Telnet. Combining vectors, such as discovering root SSH keys, may be necessary for effective escalation.
  
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">NFS (Network File Sharing) Configuration</mark>:

  NFS configuration details are stored in the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">/etc/exports</mark> file, typically readable by users.

- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Critical Element - "no_root_squash" Option</mark>:**

  The "no_root_squash" option in NFS is crucial for privilege escalation. By default, NFS changes the root user to nfsnobody, restricting file operations with root privileges. Presence of "no_root_squash" on a writable share allows the creation of an executable with the SUID bit set for execution on the target system.

  - **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Enumeration of Mountable Shares</mark>:**
    Identify accessible NFS shares from the attacking machine.
    
  - **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Mounting "no_root_squash" Shares</mark>:**
    Mount a writable NFS share to the attacking machine to facilitate the creation of the executable.
    
  - **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Executable Creation</mark>:**
    Develop a straightforward executable, commonly running `/bin/bash` on the target system.
    
  - **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Compilation and SUID Bit Setting</mark>:**
    Compile the code and set the SUID (Set User ID) bit to enable the executable to run with root privileges.
    
  - **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Verification</mark>:**
    Confirm the presence of compiled files on the target system, with emphasis on observing the SUID bit set on the executable.
