#### What is it ?

Vulnerability searching is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">crucial aspect</mark> of penetration testing, a process that involves assessing the security of a system or network. During the enumeration and scanning phase of a penetration testing engagement, penetration testers actively scan and probe the target system or network to identify potential vulnerabilities. Various tools and techniques are employed, and some commonly used resources include:

1. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ExploitDB</mark>: is a well-known and frequently used website for penetration testers. It contains an extensive collection of exploits that can be searched and downloaded. It serves as a valuable resource during the scanning phase for identifying specific software vulnerabilities and potential exploitation techniques. The official website for ExploitDB is [https://www.exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/).

3. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Searchsploit</mark>: Penetration testers using Kali Linux can utilize the Searchsploit tool, which is pre-installed in the distribution. Searchsploit allows penetration testers to search the offline version of the ExploitDB database directly from their local machine using the command line. The basic syntax for Searchsploit is:

```shell
searchsploit [keyword]
```

3. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">NVD (National Vulnerability Database)</mark>: NVD, maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is a comprehensive database that tracks and provides information about known vulnerabilities. It includes Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), which serve as standardized identifiers for vulnerabilities. Penetration testers often refer to NVD during the scanning phase to research and verify vulnerabilities in specific software. The official website for NVD is [https://nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/).

5. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">CVE Mitre</mark>: CVE Mitre is the organization responsible for assigning and managing CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). CVEs provide a standardized way to reference and discuss vulnerabilities across different platforms and databases. During the scanning phase, penetration testers leverage CVEs to categorize and track vulnerabilities. The official website for CVE Mitre is [https://cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/).
