### Understanding:
Telnet is a<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> network protocol </mark>for remote access to computers or network devices over a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">TCP/IP</mark> network. It provides a command-line interface for connecting to and communicating with remote systems. However, due to its inherent security vulnerabilities, Telnet has been largely replaced by more secure protocols like SSH. When using Telnet, the client establishes a TCP connection to the remote server on port <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">23</mark>. Here's an example of the Telnet command syntax:
```bash
telnet <server> <port>
```

**Methods for enumerating Telnet**

**Using NMap**

NMap is a popular scanner tool to identify open ports. NMap also has a set of scripts database that can be used and identify more juicy information about the target. This tool is pre-installed on Kali Linux. The below command is used to list out all available scripts related to telnet.
```bash
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep telnet
```
**Banner Grabbing**

If the telnet is open, we can easily grab a banner that may contain sensitive information or details related to services used by your target system.

**Steps:**

1. Open a Terminal
2. Enter command: telnet <target-IP> <target-port>
3. Press enter

**Using Metasploit**

We can use the Metasploit tool to enumerate Telnet. Metasploit tool is preinstalled on Kali Linux and can be launched by typing msfconsole in the Terminal.

**Using Wirshark**

We can use the Wireshark tool to further attack applications and capture the telnet traffic. By using Wireshark in between source and destination, we may see usernames and passwords in plain text.
