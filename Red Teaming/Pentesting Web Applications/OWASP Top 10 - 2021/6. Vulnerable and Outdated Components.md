### Vulnerable and Outdated Components 

Occasionally, we may find that the company/entity we're pen-testing is using a program with a well-known vulnerability.

For example, let's say that a company hasn't updated their version of WordPress for a few years, and using a tool such as [WPScan](https://wpscan.com/wordpress-security-scanner), we find that it's version 4.6. Some quick research will reveal that WordPress 4.6 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution(RCE) exploit, and even better, we can find an exploit already made on [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41962).

As we can see, this would be quite devastating because it requires very little work on the attacker's part. Since the vulnerability is already well known, someone else has likely made an exploit for the vulnerability already. The situation worsens when we realise that it's really easy for this to happen. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If a company misses a single update for a program they use, it could be vulnerable to any number of attacks.</mark>
