### Introduction

In web application penetration testing, web enumeration plays a critical role in the initial stages of the assessment.<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> It involves actively gathering information about the target web application</mark>, mapping its structure, and identifying potential entry points for further analysis. Through techniques like directory and file enumeration, discovering hidden resources, and fingerprinting web server technologies, the tester gains insights into the application's attack surface. This essential reconnaissance step helps in uncovering potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses, laying the foundation for subsequent phases of the penetration test, such as vulnerability scanning and manual testing. Proper web enumeration enhances the overall effectiveness of the assessment by providing valuable insights into the application's architecture and potential areas of exploitation

### Manual Enumeration

the results of using our own initiative over automated scans bare more results. For example, we may be able to find the "golden ticket" without making all of the noise. Let's outline some fundamentals skills involving us and our browser.

Our browser is as extensive as we're (and some!) and keeps records of the data it receives and who from. We can use this for a range of activities: finding that exact photo or more usefully -- the location of certain files or assets being loaded. This could include things from scripts to page URLs.

**Using our Browsers Developer Console**

Modern-day browsers including Chrome and Firefox have a suite of tools located in the "Developer Tools/Console". We're going to be discussing Firefox's, however, Chrome has a very similar suite. This suite includes a range of tools including:

- Viewing page source code
- Finding assets
- Debugging & executing code such as javascript on the client-side (our Browser)

Using "F12" on our keyboard, this is a shortcut to launch this suite of tools. 

**Inspecting Tool**

At first, we can see the web page with the heading "Hi Friend" and a section of the screen filled with the "Inspector" tool. This allows us to view the HTML source code of the webpage we have loaded in our browser. This often contains things such as developer comments, and the name to certain aspects of web page features including forms and the likes. 

Developers often leave behind comments in the form of the **<!-- -->** tags...for example: <!-- This is a comment --> which are not rendered in the browser as we can see here:
