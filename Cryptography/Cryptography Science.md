### What is it ?
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques used to secure communication and protect information from unauthorized access or alteration</mark>. It involves the use of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mathematical algorithms</mark> and principles to convert plaintext (original, readable data) into ciphertext (encoded, unreadable data) and vice versa.

The main objectives of cryptography are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation</mark>. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Confidentiality</mark>: Cryptography ensures that only authorized individuals can access and understand the information. Encryption algorithms are used to transform plaintext into ciphertext, making it unreadable without the corresponding decryption key.

2. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Integrity</mark>: Cryptographic techniques help ensure that data remains unaltered during transmission or storage. Hash functions generate unique digital signatures (hash values) for files or messages, allowing recipients to verify the integrity of the data.

3. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Authentication</mark>: Cryptography enables the verification of the authenticity of users or entities involved in a communication. Digital signatures and public-key infrastructure (PKI) are commonly used for authentication purposes.

4. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Non-repudiation</mark>: Cryptography provides evidence to prove the origin or delivery of data and prevents the sender from denying their involvement. Digital signatures and timestamping techniques help establish non-repudiation in digital communications.

Cryptography employs various algorithms and methods, such as <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">symmetric encryption</mark> (where the same key is used for encryption and decryption), <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">asymmetric encryption</mark> (which uses a pair of keys: public and private), <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">hash functions</mark> (for data integrity verification), and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">digital signatures</mark> (to ensure authenticity and non-repudiation).

Cryptography plays a crucial role in <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">securing sensitive data, protecting online transactions, safeguarding privacy, and ensuring secure communication over networks</mark>. It is a fundamental aspect of modern-day cybersecurity and is utilized in various domains, including data protection, secure protocols, secure messaging, secure storage, and more.
